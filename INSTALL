Instructions for downloading and installing PFS software

There is a decades-long tradition in UNIX of storing sources,
libraries, and executables in sub-directories src, lib, bin,
respectively.  We follow this convention.  

On PFS boxes, we expect the following directory structure:
/home/pfs/src
/home/pfs/lib
/home/pfs/bin
If it doesn't exist, please create it.

Go to the directory where you would like to hold the PFS software.  
On PFS boxes, this should be /home/pfs/src.  
Issue the commands below in that directory.

The PFS software is maintained in a software repository that uses CVS,
the Concurrent Versions System.  CVS is open source software that
makes it easy for multiple developers to write and maintain code, keep
track of version history, handle releases, etc.  Install CVS on your
system if needed.

Specify the path to the software repository:

% export CVSROOT=:pserver:pfs@mel.ess.ucla.edu:/data/cvsroot
OR
% setenv CVSROOT :pserver:pfs@mel.ess.ucla.edu:/data/cvsroot

Login with the PFS password.

% cvs login

You should only have to do this once.  If you don't know the password, 
call 310 206 8345 and an operator will assist you.

Then use the CVS check-out command (co) to download the software:

% cvs co fftw
% cvs co pfs
% cvs co radardecode

Compile the fft library:

% cd fftw
% ./configure --enable-float --prefix=/home/pfs
% make
% make install
% cd ..

Compile the pfs software:

% cd pfs
% make 
% make install
% cd ..

If compilation fails and you believe you followed instructions, 
please send a bug report to jlm@ess.ucla.edu.  
You may have to edit Makefile.inc if your setup is non-standard.
You may have to compile the EDT library if you have not done so.
Mac-friendly versions of the Makefile and Makefile.inc are included.

Compile the radardecode software:

% cd radardecode
% make
% cd ..

You can keep your PFS software current by periodically running:

% cd pfs
% cvs update
% make 
% make install
